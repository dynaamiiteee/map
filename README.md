**Project Description**: An interactive map that allows users to find hiking, biking, and walking trails in their area. The map includes locations and user reviews of trails.

**Project Goals**: To create a user-friendly map that helps people discover and explore outdoor trails.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open [The Map](dynaamiiteee.github.io/map/)
2. Select different points on the map to view trail information.

Instructions for using the software:

1. It works similarly to Google Maps.
2. Click on a trail to view its details, including user reviews and trail name.
## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Nothing specific is required, as this is a static website.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) - A platform for creating and sharing maps.
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A great resource for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more trails to the map.
* [ ] Implement a search feature to find trails by name or location.
* [ ] Allow users to submit their own trail reviews and photos.
* [ ] Improve the user interface for better usability.
* [ ] Optimize the map for mobile devices.
* [ ] Add a feature to filter trails by difficulty level or type (hiking, biking, walking).
* [ ] Integrate with social media to share trail experiences.
